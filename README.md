# Learning Loom - Tales of Technology and the Human Spirit

I am Shrijith Venkatramana, founder of [Hexmos](https://hexmos.com).

I am passionate about engineering, care a lot about the field, and want to help make it better for the practitioners and the beneficieries of the field (orgs and the public at large).

I started my social media journey on x, as [@shrsv23](https://x.com/shrsv23), and I kept at it actively for a while. But fundamentally - the platform didn't fit for the kind of work I wanted to do - which go in depth, into detail, and learn things in an intimate manner. I felt like the platform is filled with loud and often highly agenda driven pieces.

Next - to encourage my team to write consistently, I blogged in [dev.to](https://dev.to/shrsv) on general technical matters for a while. That was interesting, but not something truly close to my heart. I did that to help my team get into writing.

But with these two attempts - I got an inkling of what kind of writing I want to do. First of all, I am a reader. I am a reader of the old school kind, someone who set a goal to read at least a book under every dewey decimal category when in college. In hindsight, that was not the wisest way I could've set the goal, but at least I recognized while in college that reading is very important. It is how we truly connect with civilizations at a deep level. So I wanted to expose some of my process here, because I think I tend to arrive at conclusions in sometimes difficult to understand ways for people. But if only I could make a bit of my readings public - I believe, I will help others learn some wonderful thoughts from great people. My goal is - to help people share this journey with me, in their own ways. Third, I think it is important to truly listen - when we read things. That is - we must pay attention, get out of our usual self-centered position - and pretend to see from the point of other. We must try. This way we get a better sense of what life is really like for humans across the globe, of all times. 

Anyway - this will be a bit meandering, as is it supposed to be. I will not be able to share everything, but hopefully I am able to share at least many useful and interesting things along the way - with everyone, and also for my future self.
